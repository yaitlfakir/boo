### How the Prediction Works (Version 2.0)

The EA uses an advanced 16-point scoring system with smart filtering:

**Signal Generation Process:**
1. **Pre-filtering**: Checks volatility (ATR) and trend strength (ADX)
2. **Multi-Timeframe Check**: Confirms higher timeframe trend direction
3. **Indicator Analysis**: Evaluates 8 different technical indicators
4. **Scoring**: Assigns weighted points based on bullish/bearish conditions (max 16 points)
5. **Threshold Check**: Generates signal only when score ≥ threshold (default 6) AND higher than opposite direction
6. **Quality Rating**: Categorizes signal as STRONG/MEDIUM/WEAK based on total score
7. **Display**: Shows visual arrow with quality rating on chart

**Scoring Breakdown (Max 16 Points):**
- EMA Crossover: 3 points (strong reversal signal when fast crosses slow)
- EMA Trend: 1 point (current trend direction)
- RSI Analysis: 2 points (momentum confirmation when strong)
- MACD Analysis: 3 points (trend strength crossover signal)
- Price Position: 1 point (relative to signal EMA)
- ADX Direction: 2 points (directional pressure via +DI/-DI)
- Price Momentum: 1 point (current vs previous close)
- Multi-Timeframe: 2 points (higher timeframe trend confirmation)

**Quality Rating:**
- **STRONG**: 10-16 points - Multiple strong confirmations, high confidence
- **MEDIUM**: 8-9 points - Good confirmations, reasonable confidence
- **WEAK**: 6-7 points - Meets threshold, moderate confidence

**Smart Filters (Optional but Recommended):**
- **Volatility Filter**: Skips signals when ATR is below average (choppy market)
- **Trend Filter**: Only signals when ADX ≥ 20 (clear trend present)
- **Multi-Timeframe**: Requires higher timeframe trend alignment

**Example Strong Signal:**
```
UP Score: 11 points [STRONG]
- Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA (+3)
- Fast EMA above Slow EMA (+1)
- RSI > 55 and rising (+2)
- MACD crosses above signal (+3)
- Price above Signal EMA (+1)
- +DI > -DI (+2)
Result: Strong UP [STRONG] signal displayed with high confidence
```
