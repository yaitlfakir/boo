- **Meaning**: Market may be overbought, potential reversal down
- **Action**: Consider selling or taking profits on longs

#### Stochastic Oversold Alert
- **When**: Stochastic crosses below 20 (support area)
- **Meaning**: Market may be oversold, potential reversal up
- **Action**: Consider buying or taking profits on shorts

#### Support/Resistance Proximity
- **Dashboard shows**: "Near SUPPORT" or "Near RESISTANCE"
- **Meaning**: Price is within tolerance of key level
- **Action**: Watch for bounce (at support) or rejection (at resistance)

### Support & Resistance Lines

**Green Dotted Lines**: Support levels (swing lows)
- Price may bounce up from these levels
- Good areas to look for buy opportunities
- If broken, may become resistance

**Red Dotted Lines**: Resistance levels (swing highs)
- Price may reverse down from these levels
- Good areas to look for sell opportunities
- If broken, may become support

## 🎓 Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Trend Following with Dashboard
1. Wait for trend to show BULLISH or BEARISH (not NEUTRAL)
2. Confirm with ADX > 25 (STRONG trend)
3. Wait for Stochastic pullback:
   - For buys: Wait for oversold alert, then click BUY
   - For sells: Wait for overbought alert, then click SELL
4. Use `SET BREAK-EVEN` after 20 pips profit
5. Close with `CLOSE ALL PROFITABLE` when indicators reverse

### Strategy 2: Support/Resistance Bounce
1. Watch for "Near SUPPORT" or "Near RESISTANCE" on dashboard
2. Wait for confirmation:
   - At support: Stochastic oversold + RSI < 30
   - At resistance: Stochastic overbought + RSI > 70
3. Click BUY at support or SELL at resistance
4. Set tight stops just beyond S/R level
5. Take profit at next S/R level

### Strategy 3: Multiple Entry Scaling
1. Identify strong trend (ADX > 25, clear BULLISH/BEARISH)
2. Wait for pullback to support (uptrend) or resistance (downtrend)
3. Use `OPEN 3 BUYS` or `OPEN 3 SELLS` for multiple entries
4. Each trade gets same lot size, creating larger position
5. Use `SET BREAK-EVEN` once profitable
6. Exit all with `CLOSE ALL PROFITABLE` at target

### Strategy 4: Counter-Trend (Advanced)
1. Wait for extreme readings: Stochastic > 90 or < 10
2. Look for divergence on RSI
3. Check if price is at strong S/R level
4. Enter counter-trend with single click
5. Use tight stop beyond recent swing
6. Quick profit target, close with `CLOSE ALL PROFITABLE`

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Start Small**: Use 0.01 or 0.05 lots until familiar
- **Don't Over-Leverage**: Multiple trades = multiple risk
- **Calculate Risk**: Total risk = Lot Size × Pips at Risk × Pip Value

### Using Stop Losses
- **Always Use Stops**: Set StopLossPips before trading
- **Wider for Volatility**: Increase SL when ATR is high
- **Respect S/R**: Place stops beyond support/resistance

### Multiple Trade Caution
- **Multiplies Risk**: Opening 3 trades = 3× the risk
- **Use Carefully**: Only when highly confident
- **Reduce Lot Size**: If opening multiple, use smaller lots per trade

### Break-Even Usage
- **Protect Profits**: Use once trade is 20+ pips profitable
- **Don't Rush**: Give trade room to breathe first
- **Not Always Best**: Sometimes better to let original stop work

### Daily Limits
- **Set Max Loss**: Decide maximum daily loss (e.g., $100)
- **Stop Trading**: When limit reached, stop for the day
- **Set Max Profit**: Consider stopping after good profit day too

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Showing
- Verify AutoTrading is enabled (green checkmark)

### No Stochastic Alerts
- Verify EnableStochAlerts = true

- Ensure Stochastic is actually crossing levels
- Look in Experts tab for alert messages

### Support/Resistance Not Showing
- Set ShowSRLevels = true
- Increase SR_Lookback for more levels
- Adjust SR_Tolerance_Pips if too many/few lines
- Ensure enough historical data loaded

### Trades Not Opening
- Check account margin and balance
- Verify broker allows trading on symbol
- Check spread isn't too wide
- Look for error messages in Experts tab

### Break-Even Not Working
- Ensure positions are profitable by BreakEvenPips
- Check for minimum stop level restrictions
- Verify positions belong to this EA (magic number)

## 📊 Indicator Reference

### Trend (EMA Crossover)
- **BULLISH ↑**: Fast EMA above Slow EMA - uptrend
- **BEARISH ↓**: Fast EMA below Slow EMA - downtrend
- **NEUTRAL**: EMAs very close - no clear direction

### Stochastic Oscillator
- **0-20**: Oversold - potential buy opportunity
- **20-80**: Neutral zone - normal conditions
- **80-100**: Overbought - potential sell opportunity

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **0-30**: Oversold - potential buy
- **30-70**: Neutral - normal conditions
- **70-100**: Overbought - potential sell

### ADX (Average Directional Index)
- **0-20**: WEAK trend - range/consolidation
- **20-25**: Emerging trend
- **25+**: STRONG trend - good for trend trading
- **40+**: Very strong trend

### ATR (Average True Range)
- Measures market volatility
- Higher value = more volatility = wider stops needed
- Lower value = less volatility = tighter range
- Use to adjust stop loss distances

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- **Test on Demo First**: Practice with virtual money
- **Start Small**: Use minimum lot sizes initially
- **Use All Indicators**: Don't rely on just one signal
- **Respect Alerts**: Pay attention to Stochastic alerts
- **Set Stops Always**: Never trade without stop loss
- **Watch S/R Levels**: Major areas for entries/exits
- **Use Break-Even**: Protect winners once profitable
- **Keep Journal**: Track which strategies work best

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Over-Trade**: More trades ≠ more profit
- **Ignore Trend**: Fighting trend is risky
- **Use Max Leverage**: Risk management is key
- **Panic Close**: Let your plan work
- **Revenge Trade**: Don't chase losses
- **Trade Weak Trends**: ADX < 20 often choppy
- **Ignore Volatility**: High ATR needs wider stops
- **Skip Demo Testing**: Always test first

## 🎯 Performance Tips

### Optimal Timeframes
- **M15**: Fast-paced, many signals, needs focus
- **M30**: Good balance of signals and stability
- **H1**: Recommended for most traders
