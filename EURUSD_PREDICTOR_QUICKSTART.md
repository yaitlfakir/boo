# EURUSD Predictor EA - Quick Start Guide

## What It Does

**EurusdPredictorEA** analyzes EURUSD price movements and displays clear **UP** or **DOWN** signals on your chart to predict where the price is likely to go next.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This EA **does NOT trade automatically** - it only shows signals!

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install the EA
1. Open MetaTrader 5
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Open Data Folder)
3. Go to `MQL5/Experts/` folder
4. Copy `EurusdPredictorEA.mq5` file there
5. Restart MT5 or press F5 in Navigator

### Step 2: Attach to Chart
1. Open a **EURUSD** chart (any timeframe)
2. Find `EurusdPredictorEA` in Navigator panel
3. Drag and drop it onto the EURUSD chart
4. Click "OK" in the settings window (default settings are fine)

### Step 3: Enable AutoTrading
1. Click the **AutoTrading** button in toolbar (or press Alt+A)
2. Look for a green checkmark ‚úì in the top-right corner
3. If you see a smiling face, the EA is running!

### Step 4: Watch for Signals
- **Green UP Arrow** üü¢‚¨ÜÔ∏è = Price predicted to go UP
- **Red DOWN Arrow** üî¥‚¨áÔ∏è = Price predicted to go DOWN
- **Signal Quality**: Each signal shows [STRONG], [MEDIUM], or [WEAK]

That's it! You're ready to go!

## What's New in Version 2.0

### Enhanced Accuracy Features:
‚úÖ **Volatility Filter** - Skips signals during low volatility periods (more reliable)
‚úÖ **Trend Strength Filter** - Only signals in trending markets (ADX > 20)
‚úÖ **Multi-Timeframe Analysis** - Confirms signals with higher timeframe trend
‚úÖ **Signal Quality Rating** - Shows STRONG/MEDIUM/WEAK for each signal
‚úÖ **Better Scoring System** - 16-point max (vs 9), threshold raised to 6

**Result**: Fewer but MORE ACCURATE signals!

**Q: EA says "works only on EURUSD"?**
- You attached it to wrong chart
- Make sure you're on EURUSD chart
- Close and reopen EA on EURUSD

**Q: Can I change the colors?**
- Yes! Right-click EA ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Inputs
- Change `UpSignalColor` and `DownSignalColor`

**Q: How accurate are the signals?**
- Not 100% accurate (nothing is!)
- Always use stop loss
- Test on demo first
- Combine with your own analysis

## Settings You Might Want to Change

Right-click on EA ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Inputs tab:

| Setting | What to Change | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|

## Trading Tips

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Focus on STRONG signals** - highest probability of success
- Wait for 1-2 bars after signal before entering

- Don't use on live account without testing
- Don't trade during major news
- Don't disable all filters (reduces accuracy)

## Understanding Signal Quality

### üü¢ STRONG Signals (10+ points)

- **Action**: Best entries
- **Example**: EMA crossover + MACD crossover + strong ADX + HTF aligned

### üü° MEDIUM Signals (8-9 points)
- **Probability**: Good
- **Action**: Consider with confirmation
- **Example**: Most indicators aligned, one or two neutral

### üü† WEAK Signals (6-7 points)
- **Probability**: Moderate
- **Action**: Wait for confirmation or skip
- **Example**: Just meets threshold, mixed indicators

## Quick Trading Example

3. Wait 1 bar to confirm upward movement
4. Price moves up confirming signal
5. Enter BUY with 25-pip SL, 50-pip TP
6. ‚úÖ High probability trade

### Example 2: WEAK Signal (Conservative Approach)
